## Meeting Notes: 
Map Page (Back-End)
- use routes given through CTA API, use open map UIC points, show shortest route from open map points to bus/train station
- consider: places API (gives list of places in area with given parameters), routes API (shortest route from point a to point b) → store in map with filter (restaurants, cafes) → use Trie to store names
User Authentication  
- need to store users in Firebase database

next steps:
1. get routes working
- placed in trie
2. get cta api set up
3. set up database
- adding and deleting stuff from database (call to firebase)
4. user authentication
